    "text": "Warner Bros. has not yet released an official plot synopsis for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice just yet, but watching the debut trailer one can at least kind of pick up on what this movie is putting down. It seems that the world of the growing DC Cinematic Universe has labeled Superman (Henry Cavill) a controversial figure after the events seen in Man of Steel, and while there are many in the world who see him as a superhero, there are many others who view him as an extreme threat. It would seem that Batman (Ben Affleck) falls into this latter category, and uses his incredible resources to do what he can to try and stop the perceived alien menace. How the story will deal with all of the major supporting characters (of which there are many) remains a mystery."
